# Julia Language Course

This repo is the code used in [my youtube videos on Learning Julia](https://www.youtube.com/c/CharlesJansenYouTube/playlists)

This repository was forked from [Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/JuliaTutorials). It was totally restructured and the notebook will continue to be changed when i will be working on a video.
