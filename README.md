# Julia Language Course

This repo is the code used in [my youtube videos on Learning Julia](https://www.youtube.com/c/CharlesJansenYouTube/playlists)

This repository was forked from [Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/JuliaTutorials) who served as foundation of this repo. Many changes were done, and the goal isn't to be merged back into the main repo, but to continue developping as a new one with a simpler, cleaner structure of folders and files. Most notebooks had changes too from minimal to everything.
